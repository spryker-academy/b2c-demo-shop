// TODO-1: Create the class CustomerCommunicationFactory which extends the one from core

// TODO-2: Provide the TrainingFacade through that newly created factory
// Hint-1: Naming convention for methods providing stuff: getMyClassName()
// Hint-2: Have a look at src/Pyz/Yves/TrainingPage/TrainingPageFactory.php::getTrainingClient() for the right syntax
